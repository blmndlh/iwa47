			"Converting data among different model formats to ensure compatibility and interoperability among various systems and software used in agriculture and food systems.",
			"The process of identifying and removing duplicate records to ensure the database contains only unique data entries, enhancing data quality and analysis accuracy. A typical example is records from farm machines, which may reach a farm management system multiple times through different paths (e.g., on a USB stick, through the manufacturer's cloud system, through a third-party integrator) and be recorded multiple times.",
			"Combining or separating data that has both spatial and temporal dimensions to make it more fit for use (e.g., by combining blocks of geographic product application data collected over a field in one day, or splitting up a harvest data set collected over several fields at once into one dataset per field). This can also include aggregating the data for high-level overviews or disaggregating it for detailed, localized analysis.",
			"Developing tools and strategies to scalably and inexpensively identify, assess, and mitigate risks in agricultural operations, ensuring sustainability and profitability.",
			"Creating descriptions of data products that machines can automatically interpret and act upon to create a data product such as a report or an aggregated dataset or actionable insights. This capability is essential for scalable automated data-driven agrifood systems.",

			"Enhancing financial reports with semantic technologies to improve the understanding and interoperability of financial data across different systems.",
			"Ensuring the security and privacy of data collected directly from agricultural fields (e.g., through equipment or mobile applications software), protecting it from unauthorized access and breaches.",
			"Protecting data used in the administrative and support operations of agricultural organizations, ensuring it is handled with confidentiality and integrity.",
			"The process of disguising personal data by replacing identifying information with artificial identifiers, enhancing privacy while allowing data utility. This can include altering the position data in geographic datasets (e.g., yield maps), making them more difficult to trace to a specific producer while enabling inference.",
			"Implementing public-key-based data encryption infrastructure that is independent of device manufacturers, ensuring secure communication and data exchange across different systems.",
			"The responsible management and oversight of agricultural resources, ensuring they are used sustainably and ethically to benefit current and future generations. This includes keeping genotypes with traits that are approved for specific purposes segregated from others.",
